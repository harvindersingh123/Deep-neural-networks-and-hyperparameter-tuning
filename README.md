# Deep Learning with Keras: Training and Hyperparameter Tuning

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a deep learning workflow using **Keras**, focusing on training neural networks and optimizing their performance through **hyperparameter tuning**. The project addresses a regression problem, showcasing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and the impact of hyperparameter optimization.

## Deep Neural Network (DNN)
Deep Neural Network (DNN) is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers between the input and output layers. These layers, often called hidden layers, enable the model to capture and learn complex, hierarchical patterns in the data. Each layer extracts progressively abstract features, making DNNs well-suited for solving complex tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and regression problems.

**Definition:** A Deep Neural Network is a computational model that mimics the functioning of the human brain by simulating interconnected neurons, where each connection has a weight that adjusts as the network learns to minimize errors. The depth of the network refers to the number of layers, which allows it to model intricate data relationships.

Key Features of Using Keras for DNNs:
-Ease of Use: Keras provides an intuitive and modular interface to build DNNs using the Sequential or Functional API.
-Layer Stacking: Allows the inclusion of multiple layers such as dense (fully connected), convolutional, recurrent, and dropout layers.
-Customization: Supports custom loss functions, metrics, and regularization techniques.
-Scalability: Enables training on GPUs or distributed systems for large datasets.
-Built-in Tools: Includes utilities for data preprocessing, visualization, and callbacks like early stopping or learning rate scheduling.

Workflow for Building a DNN with Keras:
-Define the Model:
-Use the Sequential API for simple layer stacking or the Functional API for more complex architectures.
-Compile the Model:
-Specify the optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam), loss function (e.g., MSE for regression or categorical crossentropy for classification), and evaluation metrics.
-Train the Model:
-Use the fit() method, providing training data, batch size, and number of epochs.
-Evaluate the Model:
-Test the model's performance on unseen data using the evaluate() method.
-Optimize the Model:
Tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of layers/neurons.

### Hyperparameters  
Hyperparameters are parameters set **before** the learning process begins and play a critical role in shaping the performance, speed, and quality of machine learning models. Unlike model parameters, which are learned during training, hyperparameters must be defined explicitly and often require experimentation to find the most effective combination.  

#### Key Neural Network Hyperparameters:  

1. **Number of Hidden Layers**  
   Determines the depth of the model, influencing its capacity to learn complex patterns.  

2. **Number of Neurons**  
   Defines the computational units in each layer, affecting the model's ability to represent data.  

3. **Learning Rate**  
   Controls the step size at which the model updates weights during optimization.  

4. **Activation Function**  
   Decides how neuron outputs are transformed, introducing non-linearity to the model.  

5. **Optimizer Settings**  
   Influences how the model adjusts weights, with popular choices being SGD, Adam, and RMSprop.  

#### Advanced Hyperparameters:  

1. **Dropout Rate**  
   Introduces regularization by randomly deactivating neurons during training, preventing overfitting.  

2. **Batch Size**  
   Determines the number of samples processed before updating the model's weights.  

3. **Weight Initialization**  
   Impacts how the initial weights of the model are set, influencing convergence speed and stability.  

4. **Learning Rate Scheduler**  
   Adjusts the learning rate dynamically during training to improve optimization.  

#### Importance of Hyperparameter Tuning  

Hyperparameter optimization is the process of finding the best combination of hyperparameters to minimize a predefined loss function and achieve optimal model performance. This involves systematic experimentation, often using techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.  

#### Key Hyperparameters to Tune:  

- **num_hidden_layers**: Controls the network's depth.  
- **neurons_per_layer**: Balances complexity and computational cost.  
- **dropout_rate**: Prevents overfitting while maintaining learning efficiency.  
- **activation**: Determines non-linear transformations for better learning.  
- **optimizer**: Influences gradient computation and convergence.  
- **learning_rate**: Adjusts the step size for weight updates.  
- **batch_size**: Impacts training stability and speed.

### Loss Function  

The **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is used as the score/loss function in this assignment to evaluate the performance of the model. It calculates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, offering insights into the model's accuracy.  

#### Why MSE?  

- **Interpretability**: Taking the square root of MSE yields the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), an error metric easily understood in the context of real-world problems, such as predicting prices in thousands of dollars.  
- **Sensitivity to Errors**: Squaring amplifies larger errors, encouraging the model to minimize significant deviations.  

#### Cross-Validation for Evaluation  

In this work, we will use **Cross-Validation (CV)** to calculate the MSE for different hyperparameter combinations. This approach ensures robust evaluation by splitting the data into multiple training and validation sets, reducing the likelihood of overfitting or biased results.
